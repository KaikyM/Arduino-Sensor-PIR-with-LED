# Arduino-Sensor-PIR-with-LED

## Contextualization
In this experiment, a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor will be used, which changes its state when motion is detected. To illustrate this, an LED has been added to pin 13, which will turn on when motion is detected and turn off after one second of inactivity. Additionally, there is an option to monitor the sensor state through the serial monitor, which will display the message "DETECTED" when the sensor state changes from False to True
